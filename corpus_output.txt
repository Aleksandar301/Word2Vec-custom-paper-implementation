of the alice s adventures in wonderland illustration alice in the room of the duchess the alice s adventures in wonderland sam l gabriel sons company new york by sam l gabriel sons company new york alice s adventures in wonderland illustration i down the rabbit hole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations so she was in her own mind as well as she could for the day made her feel very sleepy and whether the of making a would be the trouble of getting up and the when suddenly a white rabbit with eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be too late but when the rabbit took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and with she ran across the after it and was just in time to see it down a large rabbit hole under the hedge in another moment down went alice after it illustration the rabbit hole went on like a for some way and then suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about herself before she found herself down what seemed to be a very deep well either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her first she tried to make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were with cupboards and book shelves here and there she saw and pictures upon she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she it was but to her great it was she did not like to the jar so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell it down down down would the fall never come to an end there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking to herself dinah ll miss me very much to night i should think dinah was the cat i hope they ll remember her of at tea time dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me alice felt that she was off when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a of and dry leaves and the fall was over alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up in a moment she looked up but it was all dark before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was up by a of from the roof there were doors all round the hall but they were all and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked down the middle how she was ever to get out again suddenly she came upon a little table all made of glass there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key and alice s first idea was that this might to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about inches high she tried the little golden key in the and to her great it illustration alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a hole she down and looked along the passage into the garden you ever saw how she to get out of that dark hall and about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the oh said alice how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin alice went back to the table half she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper with the words drink me beautifully on it in large no i ll look first she said and see whether it s marked poison or not for she had never forgotten that if you drink from a bottle marked poison it is certain to with you or however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had a sort of of and hot she very soon finished it off what a curious said alice i must be shutting up like a telescope and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden after awhile finding that nothing more happened she on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite through the glass and she tried her best to up one of the legs of the table but it was too and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried come there s no use in like that said alice to herself rather i you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very followed it and sometimes she herself so severely as to tears into her eyes soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in well i ll eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow i can under the door so either way i ll get into the garden and i don t care which happens she a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size so she set to work and very soon finished off the cake illustration the pool of tears curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now i m opening out like the telescope that ever was good by feet oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your and for you now dears i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now rather more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door poor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more than ever she sat down and began to cry again she went on of tears until there was a large pool all round her and half down the hall after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to oh the duchess the duchess oh won t she be if i ve kept her waiting when the rabbit came near her alice began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and away into the as hard as he could go illustration alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is to day and things went on just as usual was i the same when i got up this morning but if i m not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah that s the great as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to save herself from shrinking away that was a escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in and now for the garden and she ran with all back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before things are than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had when she was nine feet high illustration just then she heard something about in the pool a little way off and she swam to see what it was she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so out of the way down here that i should think very it can talk at any rate there s no in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse the mouse looked at her rather and seemed to her to with one of its little eyes but it said nothing perhaps it doesn t understand english thought alice i say it s a french mouse come over with william the conqueror so she began again o which was the first sentence in her french book the mouse gave a sudden out of the water and seemed to all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s i quite forgot you didn t like cats not like cats cried the mouse in a shrill voice would you like cats if you were me well perhaps not said alice in a tone don t be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think you d take a to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear thing the mouse was all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we won t talk about her any more if you d rather not we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of its tail as if i would talk on such a subject our always cats low things don t let me hear the name again illustration alice at the mad tea party i won t indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are you are you fond of of dogs there is such a nice little near our house i should like to show you it all the and oh dear cried alice in a tone i m afraid i ve offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a in the pool as it went so she called after it mouse dear do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then i ll tell you my history and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore illustration a caucus race and a long tale they were indeed a queer looking party that assembled on the bank the birds with the animals with their fur close to them and all wet cross and illustration the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite to alice to find herself talking with them as if she had them all her life at last the mouse who seemed to be a of some among them called out down all of you and listen to me i ll soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the thing i know silence all round if you please william the conqueror cause was by the was soon to by the english who and had been of late much to and and the of and ugh said the lory with a and even the archbishop of found it advisable found what said the duck found it the mouse replied rather of course you know what it means i know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck it s generally a frog or a the question is what did the archbishop find the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with to meet william and him the crown how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke as wet as ever said alice in a tone it doesn t seem to dry me at all in that said the dodo to its feet i that the for the of more speak english said the eaglet i don t know the meaning of half those long words and what s more i don t believe you do either what i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone is that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus race what is a caucus race said alice illustration why said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it first it marked out a race course in a sort of and then all the party were along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it and asking but who has won this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought at last it said everybody has won and all must have prizes but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices asked why she of course said the dodo to alice with one and the whole party at once crowded round her out in a way prizes prizes alice had no idea what to do and in she put her hand into her pocket and out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one a piece all round the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds that they could not taste and the small and had to be on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and the mouse to tell them something more you to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate and d she added in a half afraid that it would be offended again is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouse s tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on about it while the mouse was so that her idea of the tale was something like this fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to i will you come i ll take no we must have the trial for really this morning i ve nothing to do said the mouse to the such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath i ll be judge i ll be jury said fury i ll try the whole cause and you to you are not said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking of i beg your pardon said alice very you had got to the bend i think you me by talking such nonsense said the mouse getting up and walking away please come back and your alice called after it and the others all in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little i wish i had dinah our cat here said alice this caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once and a called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears it s high time you were all in on they all moved off and alice was soon left alone i wish i t dinah nobody seems to like her down here and i m sure she s the best cat in the world poor alice began to cry again for she felt very and low in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up illustration illustration the rabbit in a little bill it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something alice heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear oh my fur and whiskers she ll get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very good began about for them but they were to be seen everything seemed to have changed since her in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished very soon the rabbit noticed alice and called to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan now he took me for his said alice as she ran off how surprised he ll be when he out who i am as she said this she came upon a little house on the door of which was a bright with the name rabbit upon it she went in without knocking and hurried in great she should meet the mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves by this time alice had found her way into a little room with a table in the window and on it a fan and two or three of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eyes fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass she it and put it to her saying to herself i do hope it ll make me grow large again for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing before she had half the bottle she found her head against the and had to to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle remarking that s quite enough i hope i sha n t grow any more alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon she had to down on the floor still she went on growing and as a last she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will of me illustration luckily for alice the little bottle had now had its full effect and she no larger after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she till she shook the house quite that she was now about a times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened and alice s was pressed hard against it that a alice heard it say to itself then i ll go round and get in at the window that you won t thought alice and after waiting till she she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she that it was just it had fallen into a or something of that sort next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then i m here digging for yer honor here come and help me out of this now tell me pat what s that in the window sure it s an arm yer honor well it s got no business there at any rate go and take it away there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear now and then and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little and more sounds of broken glass i wonder what they ll do next thought alice as for me out of the window i only wish they could she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a of little and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words where s the other bill s got the other bill here bill will the roof who s to go down the chimney i sha n t you do it here bill the you ve got to go down the chimney alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal and about in the chimney close her then she gave one sharp and waited to see what would next the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbit s voice alone him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voices hold up his head now don t him what happened to you last came a little voice well i hardly know no more i m better now all i know is something comes at me like a in the box and up i goes like a sky after a minute or two of silence they began about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came in at the window and some of them hit her in the face alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size so she one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside they all made a at alice the moment she but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself in a wood illustration the duchess tucked her arm affectionately into alice s the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what alice looked all her at the flowers and the of grass but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself she stretched herself up on and peeped over the edge and her eyes met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly a long hookah and taking not the notice of her or of anything else illustration advice from a caterpillar at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and alice in a sleepy voice who are you said the caterpillar illustration alice replied rather i i hardly know sir just at at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have changed several times since then what do you mean by that said the caterpillar explain i can t explain myself i m afraid sir said alice because i m not myself you see being so many in a day is very she drew herself up and said very i think you ought to tell me who you are first why said the caterpillar as alice could not think of any good reason and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very of mind she turned away come back the caterpillar called after her i ve something important to say alice turned and came back again keep your temper said the caterpillar is that all said alice down her anger as well as she could no said the caterpillar it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think you re changed do you i m afraid i am sir said alice i can t remember things as i and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together what size do you want to be asked the caterpillar oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesn t like so you know i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a height to be it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar itself as it spoke it was exactly three inches high in a minute or two the caterpillar got down off the mushroom and away into the grass remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter one side of what the other side of what thought alice to herself of the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight alice remained looking at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and off a bit of the edge with each hand and now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the right hand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a her chin it had struck her foot she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed so against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to a of the left hand bit come my head s free at last said alice but all she could see when she looked down was an of neck which seemed to like a out of a sea of leaves that lay far below her where have my got to and oh my poor hands how is it i can t see you she was delighted to find that her neck would bend about in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in it down into a and was going to in among the leaves when a sharp made her back in a hurry a large pigeon had into her face and was her violently with its illustration serpent cried the pigeon i m not a serpent said alice indignantly let me alone i ve tried the of trees and i ve tried and i ve tried the pigeon went on but those serpents there s no them alice was more and more as if it t trouble enough the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the look out for serpents night and day and just as i d the tree in the wood continued the pigeon its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must come down from the sky ugh serpent but i m not a serpent i tell you said alice i m a i m a i m a little girl she added rather as she remembered the of she had gone through that day you re looking for eggs i know that well enough said the pigeon and what it to me whether you re a little girl or a serpent it a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i t want i don t like them well be off then said the pigeon in a tone as it settled down again into its alice down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the and every now and then she had to and it after awhile she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in herself down to her usual height it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first the next thing is to get into that beautiful garden how is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open with a little house in it about feet high lives there thought alice it ll never do to come upon them this size why i should them out of their she did not to go near the house till she had herself down to nine inches high pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood by his face only she would have called him a fish and loudly at the door with his it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog illustration the fish footman began by from under his arm a great letter and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet then they both bowed low and their got entangled together when alice next peeped out the fish footman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door up into the sky alice went timidly up to the door and there s no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two first because i m on the same side of the door as you are because they re making such a noise no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most noise going on within a howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or had been broken to pieces how am i to get in asked alice are you to get in at all said the footman that s the first question you know alice opened the door and went in the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a three in the middle a baby the cook was over the fire a large caldron which seemed to be full of soup there s certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing even the duchess and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling without a moment s the only two creatures in the kitchen that did not were the cook and a large cat which was from ear to ear please would you tell me said alice a little timidly why your cat like that it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didn t know that cats could said alice you don t know much said the duchess and that s a fact just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fire came first then followed a shower of and the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much that it was quite to say whether the hurt it or not oh please mind what you re doing cried alice jumping up and down in an of here you may it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions if i don t take this child away with me thought alice they re sure to it in a day or two wouldn t it be to leave it behind she said the last words out and the little thing grunted in reply if you re going to into a pig my dear said alice i ll have nothing more to do with you mind now alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that alice looked down into its face in some this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig so she set the little creature down and felt quite to see it away quietly into the wood alice was a little startled by the cheshire cat sitting on a of a tree a few off the cat only grinned when it saw her cheshire began alice rather timidly would you please tell me which way i ought to go from here in that direction the cat said waving the right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare either you like they re both mad but i don t want to go among mad people alice oh you can t help that said the cat we re all mad here do you play croquet with the queen to day i should like it very much said alice but i haven t been yet you ll see me there said the cat and vanished alice had not gone much before she came in sight of the house of the march hare it was so large a house that she did not like to go near till she had nibbled some more of the left hand bit of mushroom a mad tea party there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting them asleep the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming there s plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large arm at one end of the table the hatter opened his eyes very on hearing this but all he said was why is a like a i m glad they ve asking riddles i believe i can that she added aloud do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hare exactly so said alice then you should say what you mean the march hare went on i do alice hastily replied at least at least i mean what i say that s the same thing you know you might just as well say added the dormouse which seemed to be talking in its sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breathe it is the same thing with you said the hatter and he a little hot tea upon its the dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to myself illustration have you guessed the yet the hatter said turning to alice again no i give it up alice replied what s the answer i haven t the idea said the hatter nor i said the march hare alice gave a i think you might do something better with the time she said than wasting it in asking riddles that have no take some more tea the march hare said to alice very i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t take more you mean you can t take less said the hatter it s very easy to take more than nothing at this alice got up and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the tea illustration the trial of the knave of hearts at any rate i ll never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood it s the tea party i ever was at in all my life just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door right into it that s very curious she thought i think i may as well go in at once and in she went once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table taking the little golden key she the door that led into the garden then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and then she found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright beds and the cool fountains the queen s croquet ground a large rose tree stood near the of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it painting them red suddenly their eyes to fall upon alice as she stood them would you tell me please said alice a little timidly why you are painting those roses five and said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rose tree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads off you know so you see miss we re doing our best she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly themselves upon their there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round to see the queen first came ten soldiers carrying with their hands and feet at the next the ten these were ornamented all over with after these came the children there were ten of them all ornamented with hearts next came the mostly and and among them alice the white rabbit then followed the knave of hearts carrying the king s crown on a and last of all this procession came the king and the queen of hearts when the procession came to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and in reply my name is alice so please your majesty said alice very but she added to herself why they re only a pack of cards after all can you play croquet shouted the queen the question was meant for alice yes said alice loudly come on then the queen it s it s a very day said a timid voice to alice she was walking by the white rabbit who was anxiously into her face very said alice where s the duchess hush hush said the rabbit she s under sentence of execution what for said alice she the queen s ears the rabbit began get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of and people began running about in all directions up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all and the croquet were live hedgehogs and the live and the soldiers had to themselves up and on their hands and feet to make the the players all at once without waiting for all the while and for the hedgehogs and in a very time the queen was in a and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute they re dreadfully fond of people here thought alice the great wonder is that there s left she was looking about for some way of escape when she noticed a curious in the air it s the cheshire cat she said to herself now i shall have somebody to talk to how are you getting on said the cat i don t think they play at all alice said in a rather tone and they all so dreadfully one can t hear speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice not at all said alice illustration alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on so she went off in of her hedgehog the hedgehog was in a with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an for one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a sort of way to up into a tree she caught the flamingo and tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again just then alice ran across the duchess who was now out of she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s and they walked off together alice was very glad to find her in such a temper she was a little startled however when she heard the voice of the duchess close to her ear you re thinking about something my dear and that makes you to talk the game s going on rather better now alice said by way of up the conversation a little tis so said the duchess and the moral of that is oh tis love tis love that makes the world go round somebody said alice that it s done by everybody his own business ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alice s as she added and the moral of that is take care of the and the sounds will take care of themselves to alice s great surprise the duchess s arm that was into hers began to alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded like a now i give you shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choice the duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground all the time they were the queen never left off with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head by the end of half an hour or so all the players the king the queen and alice were in of the soldiers and under sentence of execution then the queen left off quite out of breath and walked away with alice alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all suddenly the cry the trial s beginning was heard in the distance and alice ran along with the others who stole the tarts the king and queen of hearts were on their when they with a great crowd assembled about them all of little birds and as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was before them in with a on each side to him and near the king was the white rabbit
